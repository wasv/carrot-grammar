--- PoC code ---

To Build: raco exe src/parser-tester.rkt
To Run: ./src/parser-tester
To Use: enter text, then press ^D to parse.

Plan:

1. Tokenize
    1.1. Split on whitespace.
    1.2. Group similar words. (define/definition/meaning) (skip/next) (weather/forecast)
    1.3. Identify keywords. (today/tomorrow) (nine AM/noon) (five/fifteen/twenty minutes)
2. Parse into (Command "argument") or (Command (Argument "Value") (Argument "Value"))

Unique grammar (and lexer?) for each type of action:
    How to route initial message? Which parser/lexer to use per msg?

Command w/ natural language arguments?
    "tell clock to set an alarm for 8 am"
    "tell music to skip this song"
    "tell tracker I'm feeling happy"
